### Source Code for "Zero Time Waste: Recycling Predictions in Early Exit Neural Networks"

Paper link: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05409.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05409.pdf)

The repository is split into multiple parts: computer vision experiments (`ztw_cv_original` directory),
natural language processing experiments (directory `ztw_nlp`), reinforcement learning
experiments (`ztw_rl` directory), and a new, readable rewrite for computer vision experiments (`ztw_rewrite`).

Look into the `README.md` files in these subdirectories for instructions how to configure and run the experiments.
