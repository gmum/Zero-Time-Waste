### Source code for "Zero time waste in pre-trained early exit neural networks"

Paper link: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608023005555](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608023005555)

The repository is split into multiple parts: computer vision experiments (`ztw_cv_original` directory),
natural language processing experiments (directory `ztw_nlp`), reinforcement learning
experiments (`ztw_rl` directory), and a new, readable rewrite for computer vision experiments (`ztw_cv`).

Look into the `README.md` files in these subdirectories for instructions how to configure and run the experiments.
